## [Unreleased]

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` — production overlay that adds a Caddy sidecar for automatic Let's Encrypt TLS
- `docker/Caddyfile` — Caddy reverse proxy configuration used by the production compose stack
- `docker/docker-compose.dev.yml` — dedicated compose file for contributors building from source (`make up`)
- `DB_HOST` environment variable — hostname component for constructing the JDBC URL (default: `db`)
- `DB_PORT` environment variable — port component for constructing the JDBC URL (default: `5432`)
- `.env.example` committed to the repository as the canonical environment template
- `docs/guides/production-deployment.md` — full production deployment walkthrough covering Caddy, nginx, Traefik, upgrades, and backup

### Changed

- Docker files reorganised into a `docker/` subdirectory (`docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `Caddyfile`)
- `docker/docker-compose.yml` now uses the pre-built GHCR image (`ghcr.io/inumansoul/kotauth:latest`) instead of building from source — no repo clone required to run Kotauth
- `DB_URL` is now an optional override. When not set, the compose stack constructs it from `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, and `DB_NAME`. Setting `DB_URL` directly takes full precedence, enabling external or managed database connections (RDS, Supabase, Neon, etc.) with custom JDBC parameters such as `?sslmode=require`
- `README.md` rewritten: zero-clone quickstart as the primary path, CI/Docker/release/license badges, available image tags table
- Makefile `make up` and related targets updated to reference `docker/docker-compose.dev.yml`

### Fixed

- `DB_URL` in the compose stack was hardcoded and would silently override any `DB_URL` value set in `.env`
- GitHub repository URL placeholder (`your-org/kotauth`) corrected throughout docs and config
